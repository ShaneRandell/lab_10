Lab 10 Graphing Pots

In this lab we used MATPLOTLIB to record the values of 2 potenimoters from a ardino and plot them on a Graph using python. 

This progject could be used in alot of applications, for intsnace, in my final project if i wanted to graph the output of my motor as it is dispencing a liquid
i could see how the motor prefroms. This would be very helpful in comparing how the motor performs while pushing liquids of various liquids through the syring.
